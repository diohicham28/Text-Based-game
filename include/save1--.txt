objectCode: 2202
name: crow
otherNames: raven/bird/
lookMessage: You look up at the bird, as it stares down curiously at you. At first glance it looks like any ordinary crow, but you notice that it is holding a small key in its beak. I guess it likes to collect things.
container: 1002
triggerItem: 1001
eventBeginMessage: Perched upon one of the many branches is a CROW. It watches you from above.
eventEndMessage: You place the locket on the ground and step backward. After a while, the crow flies down to inspect its irresistable lustre. Apparently unable to carry both items at the same time, the crow drops the key and takes off with the locket. It flies away into the thick forest canopy.
